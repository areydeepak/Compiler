# CS335A Project : Compiler Design
we are going to make a prototype for C language compiler and till now we have made the parse-analyzer which outputs token stream using flex.

All files are contained in src folder and test cases in test folder.	
Lexer will be build in bin folder and to run it on test cases contained in test folder:
	
	$ cd /src
	$ make
	$ cd ..
	$ ./bin/lexer<test/test1.c
